Note: In computer science, an array data structure, or simply an array, is a data structure
consisting of a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key. An
array is stored such that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple
by a mathematical formula. Insertion or deletion from an array is a costly operation. Now
write the following quetion answer.

Q1: Write a C program to delete an element (postion: 5) from an array.
Input: 4 5 1 3 7 5 24 28
Output: 4 5 1 3 5 24 28

Q2: Consider two single dimensional Array of size 50 and 100 respectively. Write a
program in C to find out the elements which are common in both arrays.
Input:
First Array: 2 3 5 1 6 7
Second Array: 10 3 5 8 4 11
Output:
Common Elements: 3 5
